# FizzBuzz

## What is it?

FizzBuzz is a simple programming problem that is often used as an interview screening question. It is also a good way to introduce beginners to programming.

## The Problem

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
